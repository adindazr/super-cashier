# Python Project : Super Cashier

## 1. Introduction
This project is a Pacmann Academy final assignment for Python Learning. We are required to create features for a self-service checkout counter at a supermarket. Customers can enter their own purchases using this cashier system. The customers can enter the goods, quantities, and pricing of their purchases. Additionally, this system enables customers from different cities to shop at this supermarket.

## 2. Objectives
The following is a list of requirements to accomplish the project:
1. Customers can create an ID transaction for their purchases.
2. Customers can enter their purchases, including the quantities and pricing.
3. Customers have the option of deleting their purchases either individually or all at once.
4. A display message that indicates whether there are any input errors.
5. A discount calculation for each transaction.


The following flowchart captures the work flow of the project based on the preceding requirements.
